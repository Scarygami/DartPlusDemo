Activate the Google+ API in "Services"
Copy your API Key from "API Access"

See example/PlusDemo.dart for example calls to the API.

See https://developers.google.com/+/api/ for the full API documenation.

No authenticated requests supported yet, so calls with userId=me won't work.

Disclaimer:
Still in very early development, and this is my first real Dart project so things might not work as expected.
